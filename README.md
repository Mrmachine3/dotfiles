# Dotfiles

This are [Hannah Ivy](https://hannahi.com)'s dotfiles.  
I use symlinks to make these my actual ones.  
I upload them to GitHub so I can sync it to my actual dotfiles.

# Installation

Look at the installation files, and try and modify them to your needs. At some point I'll make a script that *actually* works, but thats a while away.

**DO NOT RUN THE SCRIPTS BY THEMSELVES, THEY WON'T WORK.**

(Note: If you're on Windows, replace each instance of $HOME with %USERPROFILE%)  
If you don't like symlinks, just copy /Vim/.vimrc to $HOME/.vimrc, /Git/.gitconfig to $HOME/.vimrc, and /Vim/vimfiles to $HOME/.vim/ (%USERPROFILE%/vimfiles/ on Windows)
