# Dotfiles

This are [Manmeet Gill](https://manmeetgill.com)'s dotfiles.  
I use symlinks to make these my actual ones.  
I upload them to GitHub so I can sync it to my actual dotfiles.

# Installation

Run Install.bash (Install.bat on Windows) as root (run as admin on Windows).  
Make sure you are running it inside the folder that they are currently in.

# Vim Plugins to Install

These aren't included in the thing because they need to compile based on the current system architecture.
